The neutrino was proposed as by Pauli in 1931 as a way to conserve the energy of $\beta$ decay and to conserve the angular momentum of the products of $\beta$ decay \cite{griffiths2008introduction}\cite{lederman1970resource}. At the time beta decay was described by equation \ref{oldBetaDecay}. Where A and B represent the decaying particles, as the neutron had not yet been discovered by this point, it was considered a reaction between two nuclei. The conservation of energy dictates that the kinetic energy of the electron should only have a single value as shown in equation \ref{constant_ke_e_equation}. However, when the kinetic energy of the electron was measured \ref{beta_spectrum} the energy of the electron was not constant as seen in figure \ref{beta_spectrum} \cite{griffiths2008introduction} \cite{lewis1970neutrinos}. Equation \ref{constant_ke_e_equation} represents the maximum possible energy available to the electron in figure \ref{beta_spectrum} suggesting a third body in $\beta$ decay \cite{griffiths2008introduction}.


\begin{equation}
    A \rightarrow B + e^-
    \label{oldBetaDecay}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    E = \left( \frac{{m_A}^2 - {m_B}^2 + {m_e}^2}{2m_A}\right) c^2
    \label{constant_ke_e_equation}
\end{equation}

The beta spectrum shown in figure \ref{beta_spectrum} was the first indirect evidence that neutrinos may exist. However Pauli waited until Chadwick's discovery of the neutron in 1932 \cite{chadwick1932possible} before publishing in 1934 \cite{lederman1970resource}. The complete picture of a proton-neutron nucleus allowed Enrico Fermi to produce a comprehensive theory of $\beta$ decay which incorporated Pauli's neutrino into $\beta$ decay \cite{lederman1970resource} \cite{Fermi:1934hr}. Note: a translation of Fermi's work was used \cite{wilson1968fermi}. This more complete picture made sure to differentiate the particles of the nucleus (protons and neutrons) with particles that were not bound to it (electrons and neutrinos) \cite{Fermi:1934hr} \cite{wilson1968fermi}. This period however leaves us with a mass-less neutrino which has spin 1/2 \cite{lederman1970resource}. The discovery of neutrino oscillations which will be mentioned later in section \ref{section_neutrino_oscillations} indicate that neutrinos do have mass but they were discovered far after this \cite{griffiths2008introduction}. The equation of $\beta$ decay was now given by equation \ref{semi_modern_beta_decay}. The discovery of lepton number and anti-netrinos had not yet been made however and so that quantity is not conserved in equation \ref{semi_modern_beta_decay}. 

\begin{equation}
    n \rightarrow p^+ + e^- + \nu
    \label{semi_modern_beta_decay}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Direct Measurements}
propossal of cowan and riens using a large liquid scintillator detector: \cite{reines1953proposed}
\\First detection: \cite{reines1953detection}
\\distingiusing the neutrino and anti-neutrino \cite{davis1959attempt}
\\Need to find cloud chamber pictures showing the conservation of momentum \cite{griffiths2008introduction} shows them, need to find direct source. \cite{griffiths2008introduction} also goes on to explain why this matters.
\\ \cite{michel1949energy} supposedly does show this, but I'm having trouble getting my hands on it, UoL doesn't have access to nature papers! So will just have to include a picture from \cite{griffiths2008introduction} and clarifiy it is from \cite{michel1949energy}.
\\ There is also the suggestion from cowan early on that anti-neutrinos and neutrinos are differing particles,  \cite{cowan1957test}, however this is by no means certain it is possible that neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are differing spin states of the same particle.
\\ There is also the early suggestion of neutrinos and anti neutrinos being separated by a certain quantity suggested by \cite{konopinski1953universal} under a universal interaction. They use muons to suggest that certain reactions are not possible, this would later come to be known as lepton number. \\\\
Suggestions of differing types of neutrino supposedly come from the Soviet union in 1960 but this has been lost to the iron curtain unfortunately I could not find the paper myself. The earliest reference I found is \cite{pontecorvo1963neutrino} in 1963 talking about how this influences astrophysics. 
\\The direct measurement of differing types of neutrinos was done by \cite{DanbyG1962PhysRevLett.9.36} in 1962. This was done with a pion beam striking a beryllium target and a 10 ton spark chamber behind the target in order to pick up 37 events of one reaction and not another. They also make reference to kions but seem less certain about those due to experimental limitations. They call this the ``The neutrino flip hypothesis.'' This is a really important paper.\\

Experimental evidence for a neutrino had been observed as early as 1949, in figure \ref{pion_path} it is possible to see the impact of the neutrino. The neutrino itself is neutral and so does not show in the emulsion in figure \ref{pion_path} however the effect of the neutrino can be seen both in how the pion decays into a muon and how the muon decays into an electron \cite{griffiths2008introduction}. Collisions in the emulsion cannot account for the 90$^o$ change in direction as the particles decay, collisions can only account for dithering not abrupt changes in direction \cite{griffiths2008introduction}. At the time it was piratical to assume that the pion decay shown in equation \ref{pion_nolepNo_decay} and the muon decay shown in equation \ref{muon_nolepNo_decay} both produced the same particle when decaying the neutrino $\nu$ \cite{griffiths2008introduction}. However as seen in equations \ref{pion_nolepNo_decay} and \ref{muon_nolepNo_decay} lepton number and neutrino flavour were not yet known and so were not conserved.
\begin{equation}
    \pi \rightarrow \mu + \nu
    \label{pion_nolepNo_decay}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \mu \rightarrow e^- + 2\nu
    \label{muon_nolepNo_decay}
\end{equation}

The first direct detection of a neutrino would be 22 years after it's initial proposal in 1931. In 1953 Cowan and Reines proposed a neutrino detector that used large amount of liquid scintillator to detect neutrinos \cite{reines1953proposed}. This proposal was followed up the same year with a cadmium loaded scintillation detector that used a delayed coincidence measurement allowing for the reduction of background \cite{reines1953proposed} \cite{reines1953detection}. The detector worked by looking for inverse $\beta$ decay shown in equation \ref{no_lepNo_dirac_inverse_beta_decay}, though the different flavours of neutrinos were not yet known. The source of the neutrinos was a reactor at Hanford \cite{reines1953detection}. This resulted in a difference counting rates in the delayed time channels of 0.41 $\pm$ 0.20 counts/min due to the pile \cite{reines1953detection}. This result was later confirmed in 1956 at the Savanaah River Plant \cite{Cowan1956Confirmation}. This new detector used a combination of liquid scintillator in three layers and cadmium chloride doped water in another two layers in a ``club-sandwich'' arrangement. This resulted in an unambiguous measurement of 0.56 $\pm$ 0.06 counts per hour with a signal 20 times higher than the accidental background associated with the reactor \cite{Cowan1956Confirmation}. 
\begin{equation}
    \Bar{\nu} + p^+ \rightarrow n + e^+
    \label{no_lepNo_dirac_inverse_beta_decay}
\end{equation}
\\However, the difference between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos was not yet clearly known. There are two possible hypotheses: Majorana neutrinos where the neutrino and the anti-neutrino are the same particle and Dirac neutrinos where they are distinct particles \cite{griffiths2008introduction} \cite{cowan1957test}. The possibility of Majorana neutrinos was questioned as measurements of double $\beta$ decay were found to conflict with the hypothesis \cite{cowan1957test}. Suggesting that the lifetime of such a particle would be too short compared to measurements made \cite{cowan1957test}. A direct attempt at measuring the difference between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos was made in 1959 \cite{davis1959attempt}. The experiment relied on using $Cl^{37}$ and then measuring the amount of $Ar^{37}$ produced. From previous experiments \cite{Cowan1956Confirmation} equation \ref{no_lepNo_dirac_nu_capture} was known to occur but it was not known if equation \ref{no_lepNo_maj_nu_capture} occurred. If equation \ref{no_lepNo_maj_nu_capture} was not observed then Majorana hypothesis was unlikely as $\nu$ and $\Bar{\nu}$ were probably distinct particles \cite{griffiths2008introduction} \cite{davis1959attempt}. Candidates for equation \ref{no_lepNo_maj_nu_capture} were observed 20 times below what would be expected for the Majorana hypothesis \cite{davis1959attempt}. Therefore, Dirac neutrinos were considered to be the more accurate model. 
\begin{equation}
    n + \nu \rightarrow p^+ + e^-
    \label{no_lepNo_dirac_nu_capture}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    n + \Bar{\nu} \rightarrow p^+ + e^-
    \label{no_lepNo_maj_nu_capture}
\end{equation}
